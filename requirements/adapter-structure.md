# FDD Adapter Structure Requirements

**MUST read and follow**: `../workflows/adapter.md`

**This file defines**: Structure only (WHAT to create)  
**Workflow defines**: Process (HOW to create)

⚠️ **Do NOT use this file alone. Execute the workflow, not just the structure.**

---

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Define structure and validation criteria for FDD Adapter

**Scope**: Project-specific adapter configuration that extends FDD core methodology

---

## Overview

**FDD Adapter** - Dynamic project-specific configuration that evolves with the project

**Philosophy**: 
- Adapter specs **derive from design decisions**, not predefined templates
- Technical decisions appear during design → captured in adapter
- Existing projects → adapter discovers patterns from code/docs/ADRs
- Greenfield projects → adapter starts minimal, grows with design

**Purpose**: Capture and formalize project-specific technical decisions:
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architecture patterns (discovered from design/code)
- Domain model format (determined during design)
- API contract format (determined during design)
- Code conventions (discovered from existing code or defined during development)
- Build/deploy practices (from configs or ADRs)
- Testing strategy (from design or existing tests)

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Bootstrap**: Minimal AGENTS.md with `Extends` only
2. **Discovery** (existing project): Scan code/docs/ADRs → propose specs
3. **Evolution** (during design): Design decisions → update adapter specs
4. **Refinement** (during implementation): Code patterns → update adapter specs

**Location**: `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/` where user chooses:
- `guidelines/FDD-Adapter/` (common)
- `spec/FDD-Adapter/` (alternative)
- `docs/FDD-Adapter/` (alternative)
- Custom path

**Bootstrap Structure**:
```
FDD-Adapter/
├── AGENTS.md              # Minimal: only Extends declaration
└── specs/                 # Created dynamically during workflows
    ├── tech-stack.md     # From DESIGN.md + ADRs + discovery
    ├── patterns.md       # From design decisions + code analysis
    ├── domain-model.md   # From DESIGN.md Section C.2
    ├── api-contracts.md  # From DESIGN.md Section C.3
    ├── conventions.md    # From code style + ADRs
    ├── build-deploy.md   # From configs + ADRs
    ├── testing.md        # From test frameworks + ADRs
    ├── snippets/         # Code examples from implementation
    └── examples/         # Pattern examples from features
```

## Required Files

### AGENTS.md

**Location**: `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`

**Purpose**: Adapter-specific navigation for AI agents (MUST WHEN format)

**Two Phases**:

#### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Minimal)
**When**: Project initialization, no design yet
```markdown
# FDD Adapter: {Project Name}

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`
```

**That's it.** No specs, no MUST rules yet.

#### Phase 2: With Specs (After Discovery/Design)
**When**: After discovery workflow OR after design decisions
```markdown
# FDD Adapter: {Project Name}

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`

**Version**: {version}  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Tech Stack**: {Primary language/framework}

---

MUST read `specs/tech-stack.md` WHEN checking dependencies or versions

MUST read `specs/domain-model.md` WHEN working with domain types

MUST read `specs/api-contracts.md` WHEN working with API endpoints

MUST read `specs/patterns.md` WHEN implementing architecture patterns

MUST read `specs/conventions.md` WHEN writing code or documentation

MUST read `specs/build-deploy.md` WHEN building or deploying

MUST read `specs/testing.md` WHEN writing or running tests
```

**Note**: MUST rules are added **only after** corresponding spec files are created

**Specification Files** (created dynamically in `specs/`):

| Spec File | Created From | Contains |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `tech-stack.md` | DESIGN.md + ADRs + discovery | Languages, frameworks, databases, versions |
| `domain-model.md` | DESIGN.md Section C.2 + ADRs | Schema format, entity structure, examples |
| `api-contracts.md` | DESIGN.md Section C.3 + ADRs | Contract format, endpoint patterns, examples |
| `patterns.md` | Design decisions + code analysis | Architecture patterns, when to use, examples |
| `conventions.md` | Code analysis + ADRs + configs | Naming, style, file organization |
| `build-deploy.md` | Configs + ADRs + discovery | Build commands, CI/CD, deployment steps |
| `testing.md` | Test code + ADRs + discovery | Test frameworks, structure, commands |
| `snippets/{category}.md` | Implementation code | Reusable code snippets, utilities |
| `examples/{feature}.md` | Feature implementations | Pattern usage examples from features |

**Creation triggers** (see adapter workflow)

## Validation Criteria

### Two-Phase Validation

Adapter validation depends on project phase:
- **Phase 1: Bootstrap** - Minimal adapter (new projects)
- **Phase 2: Evolved** - Full adapter with specs

---

### Phase 1: Bootstrap Validation (Minimal)

**Applies to**: New projects without specs yet

#### Structure (100 points)

**Check**:
- [ ] AGENTS.md file exists at `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
- [ ] Contains project name heading (e.g., `# FDD Adapter: ProjectName`)
- [ ] Contains `**Extends**: {path}/FDD/AGENTS.md` declaration

**Scoring**: All-or-nothing - 100/100 if all checks pass, 0/100 if any fails

**Pass threshold**: 100/100

---

### Phase 2: Evolved Adapter Validation

**Applies to**: Projects with DESIGN.md OR discovered codebase

#### Structure (25 points)

**Check**:
- [ ] AGENTS.md exists with Extends declaration (5)
- [ ] AGENTS.md has Version and Last Updated fields (5)
- [ ] AGENTS.md has Tech Stack summary (5)
- [ ] MUST rules present for each spec file (5)
- [ ] No orphaned MUST rules (specs missing) (5)

#### Completeness (30 points)

**Check**:
- [ ] tech-stack.md complete: languages, frameworks, databases with versions (5)
- [ ] domain-model.md complete: format, location, examples (5)
- [ ] api-contracts.md complete: format, patterns, examples (5)
- [ ] patterns.md has ≥1 pattern with implementation (5)
- [ ] conventions.md has naming, style, structure (5)
- [ ] build-deploy.md has build, test, deploy commands (5)

#### Clarity (20 points)

**Check**:
- [ ] All specs have clear format descriptions (5)
- [ ] Examples are concrete (not generic placeholders) (5)
- [ ] Commands are cross-platform compatible (5)
- [ ] No `[TODO]`, `[TBD]`, or placeholder text (5)

#### Integration (25 points)

**Check**:
- [ ] Each spec references source (ADR ID, DESIGN.md section, file path) (10)
- [ ] All source references are valid and accessible (10)
- [ ] Specs consistent with DESIGN.md (if exists) (5)

**Total**: 100/100

**Pass threshold**: ≥80/100

## Workflow Integration

**Adapter workflows**:
- `adapter` - Create adapter from scratch or from existing codebase
- `adapter-validate` - Validate adapter against these requirements

**Prerequisites for other workflows**:
- ALL FDD workflows REQUIRE valid adapter (≥90/100)
- Adapter MUST be validated before any other workflow runs
- If adapter INCOMPLETE, must complete before proceeding

**Validation command**:
```
Run workflow: adapter-validate
```

**Expected output**:
- Score: X/100
- Status: PASS (≥90) | FAIL (<90)
- Issues: List of missing/invalid items
- Recommendations: What to fix
