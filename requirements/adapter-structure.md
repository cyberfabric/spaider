## Agent Instructions

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `../workflows/adapter.md` WHEN executing workflow

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `../templates/adapter-AGENTS.template.md` WHEN generating adapter AGENTS.md

**ALWAYS open**: `../templates/examples/adapter/AGENTS-EXAMPLE.md` WHEN reviewing valid artifact structure

**Prerequisite**: Agent confirms understanding before proceeding:
- [ ] Agent has read and understood this requirement
- [ ] Agent will follow the rules defined here

---

## Overview

- **This file defines**: Validation rules — see [Consolidated Validation Checklist](#consolidated-validation-checklist)
- **Template defines**: Structure for generation (HOW to create)
- **Workflow defines**: Process (STEP by STEP)

**Spider Adapter** — Dynamic project-specific configuration that evolves with the project

**Philosophy**: 
- Adapter specs derive from design decisions, not predefined templates
- Technical decisions appear during design → captured in adapter
- Existing projects → adapter discovers patterns from code/docs/ADRs
- Greenfield projects → adapter starts minimal, grows with design

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Bootstrap**: Minimal AGENTS.md with `Extends` only
2. **Discovery**: Scan code/docs/ADRs → propose specs
3. **Evolution**: Design decisions → update adapter specs
4. **Refinement**: Code patterns → update adapter specs

---

## Content Boundaries

**Should contain**:
- `**Extends**: ...` back to core `AGENTS.md`.
- Project-specific conventions and pointers:
  - Tech stack/tooling constraints.
  - Domain model format and location.
  - API contract format and location.
  - Validation/CI expectations.

**Should not contain**:
- PRD content (use PRD artifact).
- Architecture decisions rationale (use ADRs).
- Feature specs or implementation plans.

---

## Required Files

### .spider-config.json

**Location**: `{project-root}/.spider-config.json`

**Mandatory fields**:
```json
{
  "spiderAdapterPath": ".spider-adapter"
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] File exists at project root
- [ ] Valid JSON format
- [ ] `spiderAdapterPath` field present
- [ ] Path points to existing directory with AGENTS.md

### AGENTS.md

**Location**: `{adapter-directory}/AGENTS.md`

**WHEN clause format** (mandatory for adapter navigation rules):
```
ALWAYS open and follow `{spec-file}` WHEN Spider follows weaver `{weaver-id}` for artifact kinds: {KIND1}, {KIND2} [OR codebase]
```

**Valid artifact kinds**: Standard Spider kinds: PRD, DESIGN, FEATURES, ADR, FEATURE. Custom kinds may be added per project.

**Codebase**: Use `OR codebase` when spec applies to code validation/generation

**Valid examples** ✅:
```markdown
ALWAYS open and follow `specs/tech-stack.md` WHEN Spider follows weaver `spider-sdlc` for artifact kinds: DESIGN, ADR OR codebase

ALWAYS open and follow `specs/conventions.md` WHEN Spider follows weaver `spider-sdlc` for codebase

ALWAYS open and follow `specs/domain-model.md` WHEN Spider follows weaver `spider-sdlc` for artifact kinds: DESIGN, FEATURES, FEATURE
```

**Invalid examples** ❌:
```markdown
# Missing weaver ID
ALWAYS open and follow `specs/tech-stack.md` WHEN generating DESIGN
→ FIX: Add `Spider follows weaver `spider-sdlc` for artifact kinds:`

# Using legacy workflow format
ALWAYS open and follow `specs/tech-stack.md` WHEN executing workflows: spider-generate, spider-validate
→ FIX: Use rules-based format with artifact kinds

# Missing artifact kinds
ALWAYS open and follow `specs/tech-stack.md` WHEN Spider follows weaver `spider-sdlc`
→ FIX: Specify `for artifact kinds: X, Y` or `for codebase`
```

---

## Two-Phase Validation

### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Minimal)

**When**: New project, no design yet

**Required content**:
```markdown
# Spider Adapter: {Project Name}

**Extends**: `{path}/Spider/AGENTS.md`
```

### Phase 2: Evolved Adapter

**When**: Project with DESIGN.md OR discovered codebase

**Additional required fields**:
- Version
- Last Updated
- Tech Stack

**Required spec files** (created by `/spider-adapter` during Discovery phase or manually):

| Spec File | Contains | Created When |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `tech-stack.md` | Languages, frameworks, databases | DESIGN.md references tech stack |
| `domain-model.md` | Schema format, entity structure | DESIGN.md defines domain entities |
| `api-contracts.md` | Contract format, endpoint patterns | DESIGN.md includes API specs |
| `patterns.md` | Architecture patterns | ADR or DESIGN references patterns |
| `conventions.md` | Naming, style, file organization | Codebase exists OR DESIGN defines conventions |
| `build-deploy.md` | Build commands, CI/CD | Project has build/deploy config |
| `testing.md` | Test frameworks, structure | Project has test infrastructure |
| `project-structure.md` | Directory layout, package organization | Codebase exists |
| `security.md` | Auth mechanisms, data classification | Security-sensitive project |
| `data-governance.md` | Data lifecycle, retention, privacy | Data-intensive project |
| `performance.md` | SLAs, caching, optimization | Performance-critical project |
| `reliability.md` | Error handling, recovery, fallbacks | Production system |
| `compliance.md` | Regulations, standards, audit | Regulated industry |

**Creation trigger**: Run `/spider-adapter --rescan` to auto-detect and propose spec files based on project state.

## Spec Discovery Guide

This section defines **what to look for** and **where to find it** when discovering project-specific knowledge for adapter specs. The domains are derived from the expertise areas in Spider checklists (PRD, DESIGN, FEATURES, ADR, FEATURE, and codebase).

### Discovery Methodology

Follow the layers from `reverse-engineering.md`:
1. **Surface Reconnaissance** → tech-stack.md, project-structure.md
2. **Entry Point Analysis** → conventions.md, patterns.md
3. **Structural Decomposition** → domain-model.md, api-contracts.md
4. **Data Flow Tracing** → data-governance.md, security.md
5. **Dependency Mapping** → tech-stack.md (dependencies section)
6. **State Management Analysis** → patterns.md (state patterns)
7. **Integration Boundary Scan** → api-contracts.md, reliability.md
8. **Pattern Recognition** → patterns.md, conventions.md
9. **Knowledge Synthesis** → All specs consolidated

### Spec Discovery Matrix

| Spec File | Domain | What to Discover | Where to Look |
|-----------|--------|------------------|---------------|
| `tech-stack.md` | ARCH/OPS | Languages, frameworks, databases, infrastructure | `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.env.example`, config files |

| `api-contracts.md` | INT | Endpoints, protocols, request/response formats | `openapi.yml`, `swagger.json`, `*.proto`, API docs |
| `patterns.md` | ARCH | Architecture patterns, design patterns, state management | DESIGN.md, ADRs, code structure, existing abstractions |
| `conventions.md` | MAINT | Code style, naming, file organization, commit style | `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`, `ruff.toml`, `.editorconfig`, CONTRIBUTING.md |
| `build-deploy.md` | OPS | Build commands, CI/CD, deployment procedures | `Makefile`, `package.json` scripts, `.github/workflows/`, `Dockerfile` |
| `testing.md` | TEST | Test framework, patterns, coverage rules, fixtures | Test directories, `pytest.ini`, `jest.config.js`, test files |
| `security.md` | SEC | Auth mechanisms, data classification, encryption | Auth configs, security middleware, encryption configs, security ADRs |
| `data-governance.md` | DATA/COMPL | Data lifecycle, retention, privacy, classification | Privacy policies, data models, migration scripts, compliance docs |
| `performance.md` | PERF | SLAs, caching strategy, optimization patterns | Caching configs, performance tests, monitoring dashboards, ADRs |
| `reliability.md` | REL | Error handling, recovery, fallbacks, circuit breakers | Error handling patterns, retry configs, health checks, runbooks |

### Conditional Spec Creation

Not all specs apply to all projects. Use these rules:

| Spec | Create When | Skip When |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `security.md` | Handles user data, auth, or sensitive info | Internal tool, no user data |
| `compliance.md` | Regulated industry, PII, financial data | Internal dev tool |
| `performance.md` | User-facing with SLAs, high-load system | Internal tool, no SLAs |
| `reliability.md` | Production system, uptime requirements | Prototype, dev tool |
| `data-governance.md` | Stores user data, has retention needs | Stateless service |
| `api-contracts.md` | Exposes or consumes APIs | Self-contained tool |

### Spec File Quality Criteria

Each spec file MUST include:
1. **Source reference**: Where the information came from
2. **Last Updated date**: When the spec was last verified
3. **Scope**: What systems/components this spec applies to
4. **Actionable guidance**: Not just description, but what to do

**Minimal spec structure**:
```markdown
# {Spec Name}

## Overview
{Brief description of what this spec covers}

## {Content Sections}
{Domain-specific content}

---

**Source**: {Where this was discovered/derived from}
**Last Updated**: {Date}
```

---

## Validation Criteria

**See [Consolidated Validation Checklist](#consolidated-validation-checklist)** for complete validation criteria.

Quick reference:
- **Phase 1 (Bootstrap)**: Checks 1.1-1.10
- **Phase 2 (Evolved)**: Checks 2.1-2.15
- **Final**: Checks F.1-F.4

---

## Spec File Structure

Each spec file MUST include:

1. **Header**: Version, Purpose, Scope
2. **Content sections**: Specific to spec type
3. **Validation criteria**: Checklist for agent self-verification
4. **Examples**: Valid/invalid examples with checkmarks

---

## Error Handling

### Missing Referenced Files

**If template file not found** (`../templates/adapter-AGENTS.template.md`):
```
⚠️ Template not found: {path}
→ Verify Spider installation is complete
→ Check path is relative to requirements/ directory
```
**Action**: STOP — cannot generate without template.

**If example file not found** (`../templates/examples/adapter/AGENTS-EXAMPLE.md`):
```
⚠️ Example not found: {path}
→ Proceed with template only (reduced quality assurance)
```
**Action**: WARN and continue.

**If spec file referenced in AGENTS.md doesn't exist**:
```
⚠️ Orphaned WHEN rule: {spec-file} not found
→ Create spec file OR remove WHEN rule from AGENTS.md
```
**Action**: Validation FAIL — orphaned references must be resolved.

### Validation Failures

**If Phase 1 validation fails**:
1. Check AGENTS.md exists at adapter path
2. Verify `**Extends**:` declaration present
3. Verify Extends path points to valid Spider AGENTS.md

**If Phase 2 validation fails**:
1. Identify which spec files are missing
2. Run `/spider-adapter --rescan` to regenerate
3. For each failed check, see [Consolidated Validation Checklist](#consolidated-validation-checklist)

**Recovery**: After fixing issues, re-run `/spider-validate` to confirm resolution.
