# Workflow Selection Guide

**Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Select appropriate FDD workflow based on project state  
**Scope**: All FDD workflow selection decisions

---

## Overview

This guide helps you select the correct FDD workflow based on:
- Current project state
- Artifacts that exist or need creation
- Phase of development

**All workflows located in**: `guidelines/FDD/workflows/`

---

## ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check for FDD Adapter

**BEFORE selecting any workflow**:

1. Check if `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` exists
2. Common locations:
   - `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `guidelines/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`  
   - `docs/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`

**If NO adapter** → Start with `adapter.md` workflow

**If adapter exists** → Continue to workflow selection below

## Available Workflows

### Phase 0: Adapter Setup

### Phase 3: Implementation

**feature-changes.md** - Create or update implementation plan

**feature-change-implement.md** - Implement specific change
- **Use when**: Ready to code a change from CHANGES.md
- **Implements**: Tasks for one change, updates checkboxes
- **Updates**: Change status (⏳ → 🔄 → ✅)
- **Next**: `feature-code-validate`

**feature-code-validate.md** - Validate feature code
- **Use when**: At least one change is IN_PROGRESS
- **Validates**: Code compiles, tests pass, requirements and test scenarios implemented
- **Next**: Update FEATURES.md: Mark feature status as COMPLETE

## Decision Tree

```
START
│
├─ No adapter?
│  └─> adapter.md (or adapter-from-sources.md for legacy)
│
├─ Adapter exists, no BUSINESS.md?
│  └─> business-context.md → business-validate.md
│
├─ BUSINESS.md exists, no DESIGN.md?
│  └─> design.md → design-validate.md
│
├─ Need to document decisions?
│  └─> adr.md → adr-validate.md
│
├─ DESIGN.md validated, no FEATURES.md?
│  └─> features.md → features-validate.md
│
├─ FEATURES.md exists, need feature design?
│  └─> feature.md → feature-validate.md
│
├─ Feature validated, no CHANGES.md?
│  └─> feature-changes.md → feature-changes-validate.md
│
├─ CHANGES.md validated, ready to code?
│  └─> feature-change-implement.md (repeat for each change)
│
├─ All changes done, validate code?
│  └─> feature-code-validate.md

## Common Sequences

### New project from scratch
```
adapter → adapter-validate
  ↓
business-context → business-validate
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓
[optional: adr → adr-validate]
  ↓
features → features-validate
  ↓
feature → feature-validate (for each feature)
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
 feature-change-implement (for each change)
   ↓
 feature-code-validate
```

### Legacy project integration
```
adapter-from-sources → adapter-validate
  ↓
[reverse-engineer existing docs or create new]
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓
[continue as new project]
```

### Add feature to existing project
```
[adapter + design already exist]
  ↓
features → features-validate (update manifest)
  ↓
feature → feature-validate
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
 feature-change-implement (repeat)
   ↓
 feature-code-validate
```

### Update existing design
```
design (UPDATE mode) → design-validate
  ↓
[if impacts features: update feature designs]
  ↓
feature (UPDATE mode) → feature-validate
```

## Critical Rules

**Before executing any workflow**:
1. Read the workflow `.md` file completely
2. Check prerequisites in workflow file
3. Read `requirements/{requirement}.md` files referenced in workflow
4. Read adapter AGENTS.md if workflow requires it

**During execution**:
- Follow steps in sequence
- Validate after creation/update
- One workflow at a time
- Run from project root

**Validation**:
- Always run validation workflow after creation/update
- Meet score thresholds before proceeding
- Re-validate after fixes

**Modes**:
- Most workflows support CREATE or UPDATE modes
- CREATE: Generate new file from scratch
- UPDATE: Modify existing file

**Design system architecture**
→ `design.md` → `design-validate.md`

**Record architectural decisions**
→ `adr.md` → `adr-validate.md`

**Plan features**
→ `features.md` → `features-validate.md`

**Design a feature**
→ `feature.md` → `feature-validate.md`

**Plan feature implementation**
→ `feature-changes.md` → `feature-changes-validate.md`

**Implement a change**
→ `feature-change-implement.md` (repeat for each change)

**Validate feature code**
→ `feature-code-validate.md`

**Update existing document**
