# Architecture Decision Record Review Prompt

Review the following PR changes against ADR best practices.

Focus on:
- Ensure this problem is module/system/service scoped, not generic and repeatable
- Ensure this problem is not already solved by other existing ADRs in `{existing_artifacts}`
- Ensure compliance with `{template}` template
- Alternatives are genuinely different approaches (not straw men)
- Decision rationale is concrete and traceable to project constraints

Use `{checklist}` as the structured review guide.
Pay attention to the "PR Review Focus (ADR)" section at the end of the checklist.
