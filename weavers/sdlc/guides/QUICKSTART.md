# Spider Quick Start

**Learn Spider in 10 minutes with real prompts and examples**

This Quickstart shows examples in a Windsurf-friendly style (slash commands like `/spider-adr`).
You can apply the same flow in any agent by opening the corresponding workflow files under `workflows/`.

## What You'll Learn

1. **Exact prompts to type** - Copy-paste into your AI chat
2. **Complete example** - Task management API from start to finish
3. **Common scenarios** - What to do when requirements change
4. **Working with existing docs** - Use what you already have

## The Basics

Spider = **Design First, Code Second**

```
1. PRD
   ↓ (validated)
2. ADR + Overall Design
   ↓ (validated)
3. Features Manifest
   ↓ (validated)
4. Feature Design
   ↓ (validated)
5. Implementation
   ↓ (validated)
6. Code
```

**Key principle**: If code contradicts design, fix design first, then regenerate code.
