## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates FEATURES artifacts
- [ ] I will follow the Applicability Context rules below
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check
- [ ] I will complete the Final Checklist and provide a review report
- [ ] I will use the [Reporting](#reporting) format for output (see end of document)

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the project's domain** — What kind of project is this FEATURES manifest for? (e.g., product application, framework, library, platform)

2. **Determine applicability for each requirement** — Not all checklist items apply to all features manifests:
   - A small utility project may not need complex dependency tracking
   - A framework project may not need user-facing feature prioritization
   - A library project may not need stakeholder visibility tracking

3. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it (present and complete)
   - If not applicable: The document MUST explicitly state "Not applicable because..." with reasoning
   - If missing without explanation: Report as violation

4. **Never skip silently** — The expert MUST NOT skip a requirement just because it's not mentioned. Either:
   - The requirement is met (document addresses it), OR
   - The requirement is explicitly marked not applicable (document explains why), OR
   - The requirement is violated (report it with applicability justification)

**Key principle**: The reviewer must be able to distinguish "author considered and excluded" from "author forgot"

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Unsafe/misleading/unverifiable; blocks downstream work.
- **HIGH**: Major ambiguity/risk; should be fixed before approval.
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; fix when feasible.
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; optional.

---

## Applicability Determination

**For items marked "(if applicable)"**, determine applicability using these criteria:

| Domain | Applicable When | Not Applicable When |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Compliance (COMPL-FEAT-*) | Regulated industry, handles PII, financial data | Internal dev tool, no user data |
| Stakeholder visibility (BIZ-FEAT-005) | Multiple stakeholders tracking progress | Single developer project |
| Ownership tracking (BIZ-FEAT-006) | Team-based development | Solo developer |
| Performance distribution (PERF-FEAT-*) | Performance-critical application | Internal tool, no SLAs |
| UX requirements (UX-FEAT-*) | User-facing product | Backend service, CLI tool |
| Internationalization | Multi-region deployment | Single-locale deployment |

**When uncertain**: Mark as applicable and let the manifest author explicitly exclude with reasoning.

---

## Checkpointing (Long Reviews)

This checklist is 750+ lines. For reviews that may exceed context limits:

### Checkpoint After Each Domain

After completing each expertise domain (BIZ, ARCH, SEC, etc.), output:
```
✓ {DOMAIN} complete: {N} items checked, {M} issues found
Issues: {list issue IDs}
Remaining: {list unchecked domains}
```

### If Context Runs Low

1. **Save progress**: List completed domains and issues found so far
2. **Note position**: "Stopped at {DOMAIN}-{ID}"
3. **Resume instruction**: "Continue from {DOMAIN}-{ID}, issues so far: {list}"

### Minimum Viable Review

If full review impossible, prioritize in this order:
1. **BIZ-FEAT-001/002/007** (CRITICAL) — Requirements, Scope, Checkbox Consistency
2. **ARCH-FEAT-001** (CRITICAL) — Dependency Graph
3. **SEC-FEAT-001** (CRITICAL) — Security Requirements Distribution
4. **FORMAT-001/002/005** (CRITICAL) — Feature Entry, Required Fields, Checkbox Syntax
5. **DOC-FEAT-001** (CRITICAL) — Deliberate Omissions
6. **MUST NOT HAVE** (all CRITICAL/HIGH items)

Mark review as "PARTIAL" if not all domains completed.
