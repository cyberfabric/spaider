# Initialize FDD Project

**Phase**: 1 - Architecture Design  
**Purpose**: Create FDD project structure with Overall Design template through guided questions

---

## Prerequisites

- FDD adapter exists and is valid (run workflow `adapter-config` first if needed)
- Project repository exists
- Write permissions in project directory

---

## Overview

This workflow creates FDD project structure and Overall Design document through interactive questions. The workflow gathers project context first, then generates structured documentation with actual content instead of empty placeholders.

**Key Principle**: Ask questions, generate meaningful content, avoid empty templates.

---

## Interactive Questions

Ask the user these questions **one by one** to gather requirements:

### Q1: Module/System Name
```
What is the name of this module or system?
Example: "User Management Service", "Payment API", "Analytics Dashboard"
```
**Store as**: `MODULE_NAME`

### Q2: System Vision
```
What does this system do and why does it exist?
Describe in 2-4 sentences the core purpose and value.

Example: "This system manages user authentication and authorization 
for the platform. It provides secure login, role-based access control, 
and user profile management. The goal is to centralize identity 
management across all services."
```
**Store as**: `SYSTEM_VISION`

### Q3: Core Capabilities
```
What are the main capabilities this system provides?
List 3-7 key capabilities (one per line):

Example:
- User registration and login
- Password reset and recovery
- Role and permission management
- User profile management
- Session management
```
**Store as**: `CAPABILITIES[]`

### Q4: Actors
```
Who are the actors (users/systems) that interact with this system?
For each actor, provide:
- Actor name
- Role and responsibilities

Example:
- End User: Regular user who logs in and manages their profile
- Administrator: Manages users, roles, and permissions
- External Service: Other services that validate tokens and check permissions
```
**Store as**: `ACTORS[]` (each with name and description)

### Q5: Key Business Rules
```
What are the key business rules or principles for this system?
List 2-5 important rules that guide the design.

Example:
- Passwords must meet complexity requirements (8+ chars, mixed case, numbers)
- Sessions expire after 24 hours of inactivity
- Users can only have one active session at a time
- All authentication attempts are logged for security audit
```
**Store as**: `BUSINESS_RULES[]`

### Q6: Architecture Style
```
What is the architectural style of this system?
Options:
  1. Monolithic application
  2. Microservice
  3. CLI tool
  4. Library/SDK
  5. Serverless functions
  6. Other (specify)
```
**Store as**: `ARCHITECTURE_STYLE`

**If user selects "Other"**, ask:
```
Please describe the architectural style: ___
```

### Q7: Additional Context (Optional)
```
Is there any additional context about this system?

Examples:
- Integration requirements
- Performance constraints
- Compliance requirements
- Migration from existing system

Additional context (optional, free form): ___
```
**Store as**: `ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT`

## Requirements

### 1. Create Directory Structure

**Requirement**: Establish core FDD directory hierarchy

**Required Directories**:
- `architecture/` - Overall Design and feature designs
  - `architecture/features/` - Feature-specific designs
  - `architecture/diagrams/` - Architecture diagrams
- DML specification directory (location per adapter)
- API contract specification directory (location per adapter)

**Expected Outcome**: All required directories exist and are accessible

**Validation Criteria**:
- Directory `architecture/features/` exists
- Directory `architecture/diagrams/` exists
- DML specification directory exists (per adapter)
- API contract specification directory exists (per adapter)

**Note**: Specific directory structure (e.g., `gts/`, `openapi/`) defined by adapter

---

### 2. Generate Overall Design Document

**Requirement**: Create `architecture/DESIGN.md` with actual content based on collected answers

**Required Content**:
Generate `architecture/DESIGN.md` with the following structure and actual content from answers:

```markdown
# Overall Design: {MODULE_NAME}

## A. Business Context

### System Vision

{SYSTEM_VISION from Q2}

### Core Capabilities

{For each capability in CAPABILITIES[]}
- **{Capability}**: {Description from user input}

### Actors

{For each actor in ACTORS[]}
- **{Actor Name}**: {Role and responsibilities from user input}

## B. Requirements & Principles

### Use Cases

{Generate placeholder based on actors and capabilities:}
Primary use cases derived from actors and capabilities:

{For each actor, list 2-3 example use cases based on their role}
- {Actor} can {capability-related action}

**Note**: Detailed actor flows will be designed in Feature Design documents.

### Business Rules

Architecture: {ARCHITECTURE_STYLE}

Will create:
✓ architecture/
  ✓ DESIGN.md (with content from your answers)
  ✓ features/
    ✓ FEATURES.md (placeholder)
  ✓ diagrams/
✓ {DML_LOCATION from adapter}/
✓ {API_LOCATION from adapter}/

DESIGN.md will include:
- System vision: {first 60 chars of SYSTEM_VISION}...
- {count} capabilities
- {count} actors
- {count} business rules
- Technical architecture (from adapter)
{If ADDITIONAL_CONTEXT: "- Additional project context"}

Proceed with initialization? (y/n)
```

---

### 6. Version Control Integration (Optional)

**Requirement**: Add FDD structure to version control system

**Ask user**:
```
Commit changes to version control? (y/n)
```

**If yes**:

## Completion Criteria

Project initialization is complete when:

- [ ] User answered all relevant questions (Q1-Q7)
- [ ] User confirmed initialization summary
- [ ] All required directories created:
  - [ ] `architecture/`
  - [ ] `architecture/features/`
  - [ ] `architecture/diagrams/`
  - [ ] {DML_LOCATION from adapter}
  - [ ] {API_LOCATION from adapter}
- [ ] `architecture/DESIGN.md` generated with actual content from answers:
  - [ ] Section A: Business Context (vision, capabilities, actors)
  - [ ] Section B: Requirements & Principles (use cases, business rules, design principles)
  - [ ] Section C: Technical Architecture (overview, domain model, API contracts, security, NFRs)
  - [ ] Section D: Project-Specific Details (if provided)
- [ ] `architecture/features/FEATURES.md` placeholder created
- [ ] No empty placeholders like "[TODO]" in generated content
- [ ] Summary shown with created files
- [ ] (Optional) Changes committed to version control if user requested

---

## Important Rules

### DO NOT:
- ❌ Skip questions - ask all relevant questions one by one
- ❌ Create empty placeholders in DESIGN.md like "[TODO]" or "[Description]"
- ❌ Generate content without user input
- ❌ Assume answers - always ask explicitly
- ❌ Create files before user confirms summary

### DO:
- ✅ Ask questions one at a time
- ✅ Wait for answers before proceeding
- ✅ Generate meaningful content from answers
- ✅ Show clear summary before creating files
- ✅ Allow user to review and cancel if needed

---

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: User Unsure About System Vision

**Resolution**: Guide user with examples. Ask clarifying questions:
- What problem does this solve?
- Who will use it?
- What's the primary value?

### Challenge: Too Many or Too Few Capabilities

**Resolution**: Aim for 3-7 core capabilities. If more, suggest grouping related ones. If fewer, explore if capabilities can be broken down.

### Challenge: Unclear Actor Roles

**Resolution**: Focus on "who does what". Each actor should have clear responsibilities. Examples help clarify.

### Challenge: Existing Project Structure

**Resolution**: FDD structure integrates alongside existing directories. It's documentation layer, not replacement.

---

## Next Activities

After project initialization:

1. **Complete Domain Model Types**: Edit `architecture/DESIGN.md` Section C
   - Add type definitions per DML specification
   - Define entities, value objects, DTOs
   - Document relationships

2. **Define API Endpoints**: Edit `architecture/DESIGN.md` Section C
   - Specify endpoints per API specification
   - Document request/response formats
   - Define error responses

3. **Validate Architecture**: Run workflow `02-validate-architecture.md`
   - Ensures completeness
   - Validates structure
   - Checks consistency

4. **Generate Features**: After validation, run workflow `03-init-features.md`
   - Extracts features from capabilities
   - Creates feature structure
   - Establishes dependencies
