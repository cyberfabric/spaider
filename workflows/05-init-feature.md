# Initialize Feature

**Phase**: 3 - Feature Development  
**Purpose**: Start work on a specific feature by initializing its design through guided questions

---

## Prerequisites

- Features manifest exists: `architecture/features/FEATURES.md`
- Feature listed in manifest
- All feature dependencies have validated designs (DESIGN.md complete)

---

## Overview

This workflow initializes a feature by gathering context through interactive questions, then generates a Feature Design document with meaningful starter content instead of empty placeholders.

**Key Principle**: Ask questions, generate initial content, make it easy to continue.

---

## Interactive Questions

Ask the user these questions **one by one** to gather requirements:

### Q1: Feature Slug
```
What is the slug for this feature? (lowercase, kebab-case)
Example: "user-auth", "payment-flow", "dashboard-view"
```
**Store as**: `FEATURE_SLUG`

### Q2: Feature Name
```
What is the human-readable name for this feature?
Example: "User Authentication", "Payment Processing Flow", "Analytics Dashboard"
```
**Store as**: `FEATURE_NAME`

### Q3: Feature Purpose
```
What does this feature do and why does it exist?
Describe in 2-3 sentences.

Example: "This feature handles user login and authentication. 
It validates credentials, creates sessions, and manages authentication tokens. 
The goal is to provide secure access control for the application."
```
**Store as**: `FEATURE_PURPOSE`

### Q4: Primary Actors
```
Who are the primary actors that interact with this feature?
List 1-3 actors with their roles:

Example:
- End User: Logs in and accesses protected resources
- Administrator: Manages user accounts and permissions
```
**Store as**: `ACTORS[]` (each with name and role)

### Q5: Main Flows
```
What are the 1-3 main actor flows for this feature?
Briefly describe each flow:

Example:
- User Login: User enters credentials, system validates, creates session
- Password Reset: User requests reset, receives email, sets new password
```
**Store as**: `MAIN_FLOWS[]` (each with name and brief description)

### Q6: Estimated OpenSpec Changes
```
How many OpenSpec changes do you estimate for this feature?
Consider implementation complexity and scope.

Options:
  1. Small (1-2 changes)
  2. Medium (3-5 changes)
  3. Large (6-10 changes)
  4. Custom (specify number)
```
**Store as**: `CHANGES_COUNT`

## Requirements

### 1. Verify Feature Exists and Read Manifest Data

**Requirement**: Feature must be documented in FEATURES.md and extract metadata

**Required Actions**:
- Verify feature slug exists in `architecture/features/FEATURES.md`
- Extract feature metadata from manifest:
  - Feature description
  - Dependencies
  - Status
- Read project name from Overall Design

**Expected Outcome**: Feature verified and metadata collected

**Validation Criteria**: 
- Feature slug found in manifest
- Dependencies identified
- Project name retrieved

---

### 2. Verify Dependency Status

**Requirement**: All feature dependencies must have validated designs

**Dependency Check**:
- Extract "Depends On" from feature entry in FEATURES.md

## Common Challenges

### Issue: Dependencies Not Met

**Resolution**: Complete and validate dependency designs first (workflow 06). Design order should follow dependency graph in FEATURES.md

### Issue: Feature Not in Manifest

**Resolution**: Add to FEATURES.md first using `03-init-features.md`

---

## Next Activities

After initialization:

1. **Fill in DESIGN.md**: Complete all sections A-F
   - Define actors and flows (Section B - PRIMARY)
   - Describe algorithms in ADL (Section C)
   - Document technical details (Section E)
   - List OpenSpec changes (Section F)

2. **Validate Design**: Run `06-validate-feature.md {slug}`
   - Must pass 100/100 + 100% completeness
   - Fix issues and re-validate

3. **Start Implementation**: After validation passes
   - Run `09-openspec-init.md {slug}`
   - Implement changes
   - Complete feature
