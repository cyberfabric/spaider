# Validate Architecture Decision Records

**Type**: Validation  
**Role**: Architect  
**Artifact**: Validation report (output to chat)

---

## ⚠️ PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (MUST Complete Before Proceeding)

**Agent MUST verify before starting this workflow**:

**Navigation Rules Compliance**:
- [ ] ✅ Read `../requirements/execution-protocol.md` (MANDATORY BASE)
- [ ] ✅ Read `../requirements/workflow-execution.md` (General execution)
- [ ] ✅ Read `../requirements/workflow-execution-validations.md` (Validation specifics)

**Workflow-Specific Requirements**:
- [ ] ✅ Read `../requirements/adr-structure.md` (This workflow's requirements)
- [ ] ✅ Check adapter initialization (FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md exists)
- [ ] ✅ Validate all prerequisites from Prerequisites section below

**Self-Check**:
- [ ] ✅ I have read ALL files listed above
- [ ] ✅ I understand "Maximum Attention to Detail" requirement
- [ ] ✅ I am ready to check EVERY validation criterion individually
- [ ] ✅ I will verify `**ID**:` field in EACH ADR header
- [ ] ✅ I will run grep searches for systematic verification
- [ ] ✅ I will complete self-test before reporting results

**⚠️ If ANY checkbox is unchecked → STOP and read missing files first**

---

## Requirements

**MUST read**: `../requirements/adr-structure.md`

Extract:
- MADR format requirements
- FDD extensions (Related Design Elements)
- ADR numbering rules
- Validation criteria (100 points breakdown)
- Pass threshold (≥90/100)

---

## Prerequisites

**MUST validate**:
- [ ] ADR.md exists - validate: Check file at `architecture/ADR.md`
- [ ] DESIGN.md exists - validate: Check file at `architecture/DESIGN.md`
- [ ] BUSINESS.md exists - validate: Check file at `architecture/BUSINESS.md`

**If missing**: Run prerequisite workflows first

---

## Steps

### 1. Read Dependencies

Open `architecture/BUSINESS.md` and `architecture/DESIGN.md`

Extract:
- All actor IDs (from BUSINESS.md Section B)
- All capability IDs (from BUSINESS.md Section C)
- All requirement IDs (from DESIGN.md Section B)
- All principle IDs (from DESIGN.md Section B)

### 2. Execute Validation

Follow validation criteria from `adr-structure.md`:
- File Structure (15 pts): Header, ADR-0001 exists, chronological order
- ADR Numbering (15 pts): Sequential, no gaps, proper format (ADR-NNNN)
- Required Sections (30 pts): Context, Drivers, Options, Outcome, Related Elements
- Content Quality (25 pts): Clear context, ≥2 options, rationale, consequences
- FDD Integration (15 pts): Related Design Elements with valid IDs

Calculate total score

### 3. Output Results to Chat

**Format**:
```markdown
## Validation: ADR.md

**Score**: {X}/100  
**Status**: PASS | FAIL  
**Threshold**: ≥90/100

### Findings

**File Structure** ({X}/15):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**ADR Numbering** ({X}/15):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Required Sections** ({X}/30):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Content Quality** ({X}/25):
✅ | ❌ {item}

### Recommendations

**High Priority**:
1. {Fix}

---

### Next Steps

{If PASS}: ✅ ADR.md validated, proceed with feature development

{If FAIL}: ❌ Fix issues, re-run validation
```

## Validation

Self-validating workflow

---

## Next Steps

**If PASS**: ADRs validated, architecture documentation complete

**If FAIL**: Fix ADR.md, re-validate
