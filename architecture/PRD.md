# PRD (Product Requirements Document): FDD

## A. Vision

**Purpose**: FDD is a methodology and productized system for guiding software development through stable artifacts, deterministic validation, and repeatable workflows.

In this project, “FDD” means **Flow-Driven Development**: the project is developed by running workflows (flows), using skills/tools for deterministic checks, and iterating interactively with AI agents.

**Target Users**:
- Development Teams - Building software with clear design documentation
- Technical Leads & Architects - Defining system architecture and technical decisions
- Product Managers - Capturing product requirements and use cases
- AI Coding Assistants - Executing workflows and validating artifacts
- QA Engineers - Verifying implementation matches design
- Documentation Writers - Creating comprehensive technical documentation

**Key Problems Solved**:
- **Design-Code Disconnect**: Code diverges from design without single source of truth, leading to outdated documentation
- **Lack of Traceability**: Cannot track product requirements through design to implementation, making impact analysis difficult
- **Unstructured Development**: No repeatable process for design and implementation, causing inconsistent quality
- **AI Integration Challenges**: AI agents cannot follow methodology without structured guidance and machine-readable specifications
- **Validation Complexity**: Manual design reviews are time-consuming and miss structural issues

**Success Criteria**:
- A new user can complete adapter initialization and reach a first passing PRD validation (`fdd validate --artifact architecture/PRD.md`) in ≤ 60 minutes.
- Deterministic validation of the PRD completes in ≤ 3 seconds on a typical developer laptop.
- 100% of `fdd-fdd-actor-*` IDs defined in the PRD are resolvable via deterministic search (`fdd where-defined`) without ambiguity.
- CI validation feedback for PRD changes is produced in ≤ 2 minutes from push to default branch.
- Users can apply a small PRD update (single section change) via `/fdd-prd` in ≤ 10 minutes end-to-end, including re-validation.

**Capabilities**:
- Execute workflows to create/update/validate artifacts
- Provide deterministic validation and traceability scanning
- Support adapter-driven configuration for different projects and tech stacks
